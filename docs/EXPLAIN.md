# SignalForge - Project Handover & Engineering Overview

## Project Overview

SignalForge is a full-stack personal market intelligence platform designed to help users:

* Analyze stocks
* Maintain watchlists
* Track trades
* Visualize market charts
* Receive structured technical insights

The goal is NOT to create an AI stock predictor.

The goal is to build a production-style analytics platform that demonstrates:

# Database Models

## User

Purpose:

Stores registered users.

Important Fields:

* id
* username
* email
* hashed_password
* is_active
* created_at
* last_login_at

Relationships:

* One User → Many Watchlists
* One User → Many Trades
* One User → Many Refresh Tokens

---

## Watchlist

Purpose:

Stores named watchlists created by users.

Example:

```text
Tech Stocks
Long Term Investments
Swing Trades
```

Relationships:

* Belongs to User
* Contains WatchlistItems

---

## WatchlistItem

Purpose:

Stores tickers inside watchlists.

Example:

```text
AAPL
MSFT
RELIANCE
TCS
```

---

## Trade

Purpose:

Stores user trade journal entries.

Planned Usage:

* Buy records
* Sell records
* Trade analytics
* Win rate calculations

---

## MarketData

Purpose:

Stores historical market data.

Planned Usage:

* Chart generation
* Indicators
* Technical analysis

---

## RefreshToken

Purpose:

Stores refresh token metadata.

Added during Sprint 1 hardening.

Used for:

* Token rotation
* Session management
* Future token revocation

---

# Authentication System

## Registration Flow

```text
Register Request
      |
      v
Validate Input
      |
      v
Hash Password
      |
      v
Store User
      |
      v
Return User Response
```

Endpoint:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/register
```

---

## Login Flow

```text
Identifier + Password
          |
          v
Verify User
          |
          v
Verify Password
          |
          v
Generate Access Token
          |
          v
Generate Refresh Token
          |
          v
Return Tokens
```

Endpoint:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login
```

---

## Protected Routes

Protected routes use:

```python
Depends(get_current_user)
```

Example:

```http
GET /api/v1/auth/me
```

---

## Refresh Tokens

Current Status:

Implemented.

Purpose:

* Renew access tokens
* Maintain user sessions

Future Improvements:

* Revocation
* Logout Everywhere
* Session Dashboard

---

## Rate Limiting

Sprint 1 hardening introduced login protection.

Purpose:

```text
Prevent brute-force attacks
Limit repeated login attempts
Protect authentication endpoints
```

---

# API Endpoints

## Health

```http
GET /api/v1/health
```

---

## Authentication

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
GET  /api/v1/auth/me
```

---

## Watchlists

Current:

```http
GET    /api/v1/watchlists
POST   /api/v1/watchlists
GET    /api/v1/watchlists/{watchlist_id}
PATCH  /api/v1/watchlists/{watchlist_id}
DELETE /api/v1/watchlists/{watchlist_id}
POST   /api/v1/watchlists/{watchlist_id}/items
DELETE /api/v1/watchlists/{watchlist_id}/items/{ticker}
```

Implemented authenticated Watchlist CRUD with ticker management, ticker normalization, ownership validation, deterministic ordering, and integration tests.

---

## Trades

Current:

```http
GET /api/v1/trades/status
```

Placeholder endpoint.

---

## Market Data

# Major Bugs Encountered

## Sprint 0

### Alembic Metadata Import

Issue:

```text
ImportError: Base not found
```

Cause:

Wrong Base import path.

Resolution:

Use models.base as metadata source.

---

### PostgreSQL Authentication Failure

Issue:

```text
password authentication failed for user postgres
```

Cause:

Credential mismatch.

Resolution:

Align DATABASE_URL with actual PostgreSQL credentials.

---

## Sprint 1

### bcrypt Compatibility Issue

Issue:

```text
password cannot be longer than 72 bytes
```

Observed with:

```text
passlib 1.7.4
bcrypt 5.0.0
```

Resolution:

```text
bcrypt==4.0.1
```

---

### Login 422 Error

Cause:

Login schema expects:

```json
{
  "identifier": "...",
  "password": "..."
}
```

not:

```json
{
  "email": "..."
}
```

Resolution:

Use identifier field.

# AI Agent Instructions

Before modifying code:

1. Read this file.
2. Inspect current models.
3. Inspect current migrations.
4. Inspect authentication implementation.
5. Do not duplicate existing functionality.
6. Prefer incremental changes.
7. Preserve Alembic migration history.
8. Preserve JWT authentication architecture.

---

# Recommended Next Task

Implement Watchlist CRUD.

Priority Order:

1. Create Watchlist
2. List User Watchlists
3. Add Ticker

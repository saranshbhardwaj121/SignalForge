# Major Bugs Encountered

## Sprint 0

### Alembic Metadata Import

Issue:

```text
ImportError: Base not found
```

Cause:

Wrong Base import path.

Resolution:

Use models.base as metadata source.

---

### PostgreSQL Authentication Failure

Issue:

```text
password authentication failed for user postgres
```

Cause:

Credential mismatch.

Resolution:

Align DATABASE_URL with actual PostgreSQL credentials.

---

## Sprint 1

### bcrypt Compatibility Issue

Issue:

```text
password cannot be longer than 72 bytes
```

Observed with:

```text
passlib 1.7.4
bcrypt 5.0.0
```

Resolution:

```text
bcrypt==4.0.1
```

---

### Login 422 Error

Cause:

Login schema expects:

```json
{
  "identifier": "...",
  "password": "..."
}
```

not:

```json
{
  "email": "..."
}
```

Resolution:

Use identifier field.

# Sprint 10B — Smart Search

## Objective

Upgrade Insique search from a basic ticker input into an intelligent stock discovery system.

---

## Problem Statement

After Sprint 10A, users could navigate efficiently but still needed prior knowledge of ticker symbols.

Examples:

User knows:

HDFCBANK.NS

Search succeeds.

User knows only:

HDFC Bank

Search fails.

This created a discovery problem for new users.

---

## Features Implemented

### Intelligent Autocomplete

Added real-time ticker suggestions while typing.

Examples:

Input:

hd

Suggestions:

* HDFCBANK.NS
* HDFCLIFE.NS
* HDFCAMC.NS

---

### Company Name Search

Users can now search using company names instead of exact ticker symbols.

Examples:

Input:

HDFC Bank

Result:

HDFCBANK.NS

Input:

Reliance

Result:

RELIANCE.NS

Benefits:

* Lower learning curve
* Faster stock discovery

---

### Exchange Awareness

Search results now display exchange information.

Examples:

* NSE (NS)
* BSE (BO)

Benefits:

* Better ticker identification
* Reduced ambiguity

---

Features:

* Dynamic suggestions
* Click-to-select
* Keyboard navigation support
* Loading states
* Error states

---

### Search Provider Integration

After:

User can search naturally.

Examples:

* hdfc
* reliance
* tata
* infosys

Result:

* Easier stock discovery
* Better onboarding experience
* Reduced user friction

---

## Technical Improvements

### Debounced Requests

Search requests are delayed briefly while typing.

Benefits:

* Reduced API calls
* Better performance
* Improved responsiveness

---

### Cached Results

Frequently requested searches are cached.

Benefits:

* Faster repeat searches
* Reduced provider load

---

### Error Handling

# Sprint 11A — Alert Engine

## Objective

* Signal Alerts
* Confidence Alerts
* RSI Alerts

Examples:

# Sprint 11B — Notification Center

## Objective

Transform Insique's Alert Engine into a proactive user notification system by delivering triggered alerts directly inside the platform.

---

## Problem Statement

Sprint 11A introduced automated alert evaluation and trigger detection.

However, users still needed to manually review alert history to discover whether an alert had fired.

Workflow before Sprint 11B:

Alert triggers

↓

Trigger stored in database

↓

User manually opens Alerts page

↓

User checks trigger history

This reduced the practical value of alerts because important events could still be overlooked.

---

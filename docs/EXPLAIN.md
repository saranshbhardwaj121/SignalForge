# Major Bugs Encountered

## Sprint 0

### Alembic Metadata Import

Issue:

```text
ImportError: Base not found
```

Cause:

Wrong Base import path.

Resolution:

Use models.base as metadata source.

---

### PostgreSQL Authentication Failure

Issue:

```text
password authentication failed for user postgres
```

Cause:

Credential mismatch.

Resolution:

Align DATABASE_URL with actual PostgreSQL credentials.

---

## Sprint 1

### bcrypt Compatibility Issue

Issue:

```text
password cannot be longer than 72 bytes
```

Observed with:

```text
passlib 1.7.4
bcrypt 5.0.0
```

Resolution:

```text
bcrypt==4.0.1
```

---

### Login 422 Error

Cause:

Login schema expects:

```json
{
  "identifier": "...",
  "password": "..."
}
```

not:

```json
{
  "email": "..."
}
```

Resolution:

Use identifier field.

# Sprint 10B — Smart Search

## Objective

Upgrade Insique search from a basic ticker input into an intelligent stock discovery system.

---

## Problem Statement

After Sprint 10A, users could navigate efficiently but still needed prior knowledge of ticker symbols.

Examples:

User knows:

HDFCBANK.NS

Search succeeds.

User knows only:

HDFC Bank

Search fails.

This created a discovery problem for new users.

---

## Features Implemented

### Intelligent Autocomplete

Added real-time ticker suggestions while typing.

Examples:

Input:

hd

Suggestions:

* HDFCBANK.NS
* HDFCLIFE.NS
* HDFCAMC.NS

---

### Company Name Search

Users can now search using company names instead of exact ticker symbols.

Examples:

Input:

HDFC Bank

Result:

HDFCBANK.NS

Input:

Reliance

Result:

RELIANCE.NS

Benefits:

* Lower learning curve
* Faster stock discovery

---

### Exchange Awareness

Search results now display exchange information.

Examples:

* NSE (NS)
* BSE (BO)

Benefits:

* Better ticker identification
* Reduced ambiguity

---

### Search Suggestion Dropdown

Implemented an interactive search results panel.

Features:

* Dynamic suggestions
* Click-to-select
* Keyboard navigation support
* Loading states
* Error states

---

### Search Provider Integration

Integrated Yahoo Finance search infrastructure through backend proxy services.

Benefits:

* Large ticker coverage
* Company name matching
* Relevance ranking
* No manual ticker catalog maintenance

---

## Architecture Changes

### Backend

Added:

* Search Service Layer
* Search API Endpoint
* Search Response Schemas

Responsibilities:

* Query external provider
* Normalize responses
* Cache results
* Handle failures gracefully

---

### Frontend

Added:

* Search API hooks
* Search result types
* Suggestion dropdown component
* Search query utilities

Responsibilities:

* Debounced search requests
* Suggestion rendering
* Selection handling
* Keyboard interactions

---

## Search Flow

User Types:

mtar

↓

Frontend Debounce

↓

Search Endpoint

↓

Yahoo Finance Search

↓

Results Returned

↓

Suggestions Displayed

Example Result:

* MTARTECH.NS
* MTARTECH.BO

---

## User Experience Improvements

Before:

User must know exact ticker.

Example:

HDFCBANK.NS

After:

User can search naturally.

Examples:

* hdfc
* reliance
* tata
* infosys

Result:

* Easier stock discovery
* Better onboarding experience
* Reduced user friction

---

## Technical Improvements

### Debounced Requests

Search requests are delayed briefly while typing.

Benefits:

* Reduced API calls
* Better performance
* Improved responsiveness

---

### Cached Results

Frequently requested searches are cached.

Benefits:

* Faster repeat searches
* Reduced provider load

---

### Error Handling

Implemented graceful failure states.

Examples:

* Provider unavailable
* Network failure
* Empty search results

Benefits:

* Better resilience
* Improved user feedback

---

## Outcome

Sprint 10B successfully transformed search into an intelligent discovery system.

Users no longer need exact ticker knowledge to find stocks.

This sprint significantly improves usability and onboarding while creating the foundation for future recommendation systems.

Future Expansion:

* Popular Stocks
* High Confidence Suggestions
* Recommendation Ranking
* Signal-Aware Search

Status: COMPLETE
